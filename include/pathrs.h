 *
 * The provided path must be an existing directory. If using the emulated
 * driver, it also must be the fully-expanded path to a real directory (with no
 * symlink components) because the given path is used to double-check that the
 * open operation was not affected by an attacker.
 *
 * NOTE: Unlike other libpathrs methods, pathrs_open will *always* return a
 *       pathrs_root_t (but in the case of an error, the returned root handle
 *       will be a "dummy" which is just used to store the error encountered

 *       immediately calling pathrs_error() with the returned root handle --
 *       and as with valid root handles, the caller must free it with
 *       pathrs_free().
 *
 *       This unfortunate API wart is necessary because there is no obvious
 *       place to store a libpathrs error when first creating an root handle
 *       (other than using thread-local storage but that opens several other
 *       cans of worms). This approach was chosen because in principle users
